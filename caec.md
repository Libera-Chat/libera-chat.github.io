1. **Be nice to each other. No bigotry or personal attacks.**

   This rule is all about promoting a friendly and respectful atmosphere. It
   means players should avoid making hurtful or offensive comments toward
   others. "Bigotry" refers to intolerance or prejudice against others based
   on race, gender, religion, etc. Personal attacks are direct insults
   targeting someone's character or appearance. Essentially, treat others the
   way youâ€™d like to be treated.

2. **Spam in all forms is not allowed (e.g. excessive bot commands, pasting
   excessive amounts of text).**

   Spam refers to any repetitive, irrelevant, or disruptive content that
   clutters the chat. This could include overusing bot commands, posting long
   chunks of text that are unrelated to the game, or flooding the chat with
   messages that make it hard to follow conversations. The goal is to keep the
   chat clean and focused on the game.

3. **Players may not discuss gameplay in PM (Private Messages).**

   This rule is likely in place to prevent players from gaining an unfair
   advantage. By restricting gameplay discussion to public channels, it
   ensures that all players have access to the same information. If players
   were allowed to talk privately, they could share strategies or help each
   other out, which might undermine the competitive aspect of the game.

Overall, these rules are meant to keep the game fair, fun, and respectful for
everyone involved.
