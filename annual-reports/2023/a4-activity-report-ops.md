title: Activity Report 2023 - Operations
---

The operations team manages the provisioning and maintenance of the various
servers and services Libera.Chat uses to provide IRC chat services. We keep
the servers running, configured, and updated.

Libera.Chat is made possible by a wide variety of free and open-source
software. While we’re obviously reliant on solanum and atheme, there are many
other packages critical to running our network. If you aren’t already familiar
with these projects, you might take a look: Debian, Etherpad, Gamja, Grafana,
Kiwiirc, Mlmmj, Mumble, Nginx, Postfix, Puppet, Request Tracker, Tor,
WireGuard.

We're also responsible for  coordinating with the sponsors who make
Libera.Chat possible by providing reliable servers and network connectivity.
We're continually thankful to them all for providing the hardware and other
resources required to allow the network to operate.
