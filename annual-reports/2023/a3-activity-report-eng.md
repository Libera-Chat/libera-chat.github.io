title: Activity Report 2022 - Engineering
---

Libera Chat's engineering team is responsible for developing and maintaining
the software used to provide the IRC network and any auxiliary services as
Libera requires.

## Team Organisation

The team ended the year with 14 members, up one from last year. We continue to
hold development team meetings subject to there being topics to discuss.

## Activity

Engineering activity has been split into two main areas: incremental
improvements to our current server platform, and development of our
experimental next-generation software.

In the last year we have delivered several improvements to the user experience
on the network, including:

- User mode +I, to hide your idle time
- The $g extended ban type, to match users who match a given pattern and are
  not logged in to services
- Throttling of password-based login attempts, and made login failure notices
  opt-in to reduce unnecessary noise
- Connection shedding support, to reduce the impact of planned maintenance on
  the network
- Improved behaviour and error messages in a number of unusual or exceptional
  situations

Development of Sable, our experimental next-generation server, continues at a
variable pace, and we continue to welcome contributions from
anyone interested.
