The board for Libera Chat (802535-6448) hereby submits their annual report
for the fiscal year 2024-01-01 -- 2024-12-31.

## General

Libera Chat operates a general purpose IRC network which at the end of the
year served approx 131 000 registered users and 28 000 registered channels.

Libera Chat's general purpose IRC network was launched 2021-05-19 and is
operated by the organisation's members on a volunteer basis. All
infrastructure used for the network is donated and/or sponsored.

At the end of the fiscal year the organisation had 38 members.

We thank our sponsors for their continued support in providing infrastructure,
everyone who has supported us with donations, over one thousand projects
who have decided to call Libera Chat home for their IRC presence, and all of
our users who continue to make Libera Chat a thriving IRC network.

## Finances

The result for the year is approximately 5 000 SEK, compared to approximately
600 SEK last year.

The result is split into approximately 1 000 SEK operating profit, which totals
all of our incoming donations and operating expenses, and approximately
4 000 SEK in interest on our larger one-time donation from two years ago, which
is held as a reserve in case of unexpected events or future major projects.

We thank everyone who has made a monetary donation or made a purchase via
our merchandise partnership. These funds directly fund our organisational
costs, and as can be seen by our operating profit the financial forecasting
that led to us setting up a donation target on our donation plattform was
accurate enough and means that we comfortably didn't ask for more money than
necessary. We are in a comfortable situation where our emergency fund is
stable enough that we can set donation targets low.

Libera Chat's expenses for the year have only been for domains, PO Box,
accounting software, and banking services.

During the year we had issues receiving emails from one of our vendors, and an
invoice from them was missed. This was not uncovered until about 1 month later
when we started to wonder why this expected invoice had not arrived. The invoice
was promptly paid, and we would like to extend a thank you to our Operations
team for swiftly mitigating the email issues. In our full financial report the
costs incurred from late-fees, interest, and debt collection can therefore be
seen.

It should also be noted that since August of 2024, Liberapay has stopped reporting
the transaction fees for secret donations for all transactions. Previously this
was only missing for grouped transactions. Therefore our reported donation volumes
and expenses may have slightly different proportions, especially in 2025.

The full financial report can be found in Appendix 1.
