title: Activity Report 2024 - Operations
---

The operations team manages the provisioning and maintenance of the various
servers and services Libera.Chat uses to provide IRC chat services. We keep the
servers running, configured, and updated. Libera.Chat is made possible by a
wide variety of free and open-source software.

## Improvements

During the year we have continued to optimise our Puppet controlled
deployments. As part of this process we've started relying more heavily on the
limited free resource that is GitHub Compute and have therefore added local
build agents to reduce our reliance on GitHub and utilise some of the idle
compute we have. This allows us to validate proposed changes more intensively
before merging them into production.

## Future plans

We are hoping to grow our sponsor base a little in the coming year, with one or
two potential offerings already underway.
