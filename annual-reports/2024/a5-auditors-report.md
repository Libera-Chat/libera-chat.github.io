title: Auditor's Report 2024
---

The role of auditor is responsible for ensuring that there is no financial
impropriety nor gross misconduct on the part of the organisation's board
members, and to denote instances of the board not acting in the best
interests of the organisation's membership.

I find that the organisation's finances are sound and that its money has
only been utilised in ways approved by the membership.

I find that the board has not acted in a grossly irresponsible manner, nor
violated the organisation's bylaws.

With this in mind, I recommend that the board members be discharged of
liability for the period 2024-01-01 through 2024-12-31 inclusive.
