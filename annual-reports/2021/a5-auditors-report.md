title: Auditor's Report 2021
---

The purpose of the audit report is to identify any significant errors in the
organisations accounts, or the conduct of the board during the last year.

In doing so, we have not found any indication or evidence of misconduct by the
board, nor any serious errors in the finances.

With this considered, the auditors recommend that the board be granted
discharge from liability.
