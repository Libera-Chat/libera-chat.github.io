title: Auditor's Report 2022
---

We have not found any evidence of misconduct or malicious activity in either the
Organizations accounts or the conduct of the board over the past year.

We do note that publication of the April MGM minutes was late; and while this
is a violation of our bylaws, we do not believe that this was intentional or
malicious, and as such does not in our opinion constitute a reason not to grant
discharge.

Thus, we the auditors recommend that the board be discharged of liability
over the past year.
