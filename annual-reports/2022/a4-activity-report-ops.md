title: Activity Report 2022 - Operations
---

The operations team manages the provisioning and maintenance of the
various servers and services Libera.Chat uses to provide IRC chat
services. We keep the servers running, configured, and updated.

Libera.Chat is made possible by a wide variety of free and open-source
software. While we're obviously reliant on solanum and atheme, there are
many other packages critical to running our network. If you aren't
already familiar with these projects, you might take a look: Debian,
Etherpad, Gamja, Grafana, Kiwiirc, Mlmmj, Mumble, Nginx, Postfix,
Puppet, RT, Tor, WireGuard.

This year the operations team has continued to work to provide the
infrastructure required to run the network. We're concentrating on opening up
involvement to the rest of staff and allowing all organisation members to more
easily influence how the infrastrucutre is managed.

We've also expanded the team to include new expertise in Puppet that has
allowed us to create an environment where we can better test and automate our
configuration management.

The operations team is responsible for coordinating with the sponsors
who make Libera.Chat possible by providing reliable servers and network
connectivity. Our team is grateful to these sponsors for stepping up so
quickly and making Libera.Chat possible this year when they were needed
the most. Many of our sponsors can be found on our
[sponsors](https://libera.chat/sponsors/) page, but even more
organizations have thrown in their support to make this project
possible.
