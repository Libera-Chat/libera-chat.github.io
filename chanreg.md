Our [policies](/policies) outline that channels on Libera.Chat fall into one
of three categories and two namespaces. Channels that begin with only a single
`#` character are either project or community channels. Channels that begin
with two `#` characters are informal channels.

## Project registration

Project registration allows your [project](/chanreg/registration-projects) or
[community](/chanreg/registration-projects) to have an official representation
on our services and relationship with us. Please follow the links to find out
more about this process and register with us.

### Project Channels

Project channels are reserved for on-topic channels as per our
[on-topic projects](/chanreg/registration-projects), represented by owners with
an official claim to that name. A registered project as per the
[registration here](/chanreg/registration-projects) can
claim ownership over project channels bearing the group's names or name
prefixes. For example, Libera.Chat itself owns the channel `#libera` and all
channels beginning with `#libera-`. As per our [policies](/policies), these
channels do not expire.

### Community Channels

Community channels are reserved for on-topic channels as per our
[community groups](/chanreg/registration-communities).
An official claim to the name is not needed, but not having it bears the risk
of losing the channel should an on-topic entity with a valid claim start an
official presence on Libera.Chat. Staff will try to find a good solution for
both parties in such cases.

### Informal Channels

Informal channels are for topics not covered by our
[on-topic projects](/chanreg/registration-projects). As per our [policies](/policies),
such channels can exist on Libera.Chat as long as they do not disturb the
operations of our network and our project and community channels, and adhere
to the network policies. Informal channels are given out on a first-come,
first-served basis. They will expire if unused for a long time, see our
[policies](/policies) for details regarding when this occurs. You can
contact us on IRC with a request to take over an expired secondary channel.

## The Projects & Community Team

The Projects & Community Team comprises, among others, e, Fuchs, kline
and Swant; together they will act as your liaisons during the project
registration or topic claiming process and throughout your tenure on the
Libera.Chat network. If you wish to discuss the registration process, find out
if Libera.Chat could be a good fit for your project or register your project,
please feel free to drop any of the team members a line on IRC. If none are
online, feel free to reach out to staff in general and they will forward your
request to the team, which will get back to you as soon as possible. Once you
have discussed your project with a staff member, you'll be asked to email
<projects@libera.chat> with the details of your request as per the above.
