There are several different ways to connect to IRC; this page gives
an overview of good clients for first-time IRC users.
Once you have chosen a client to use, please refer to our repository of
instructions for [setting up SASL](/guides/sasl), which is our preferred
authentication method.

If you're interested in ensuring the security of your connection, please
refer to our [connection guide](/guides/connect).

## Connecting without installing anything

If you cannot or do not wish to install a client on your computer, you can use
a web client.

We provide two web clients:

- [KiwiIRC](https://web.libera.chat), a robust web client
- [gamja](https://web.libera.chat/gamja), a lightweight web client

[IRCCloud](https://irccloud.com) is a popular web client service that keeps
you connected after closing the page and has a limited free plan. It also
has iOS and Android apps.

## Installing an IRC client

### Terminal clients

Terminal or text-based clients are clients which you primarily navigate with
keyboard shortcuts. These typically do not need mouse navigation, so they are
great for running on servers and accessing remotely.

Both of these are free and run under Linux, macOS, and Windows (using WSL or Cygwin)
