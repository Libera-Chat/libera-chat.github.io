### On-topic projects

Projects considered to be on-topic for Libera.Chat are primarily free and
open-source software projects, and other peer-directed projects, for instance
Linux User Groups (LUGs), student societies, hacker- or makerspaces and other
collaborative efforts. It can also cover projects/companies of general
interest to our user base.

### Claim to the name and representation

A claim to the name is given if your project is on-topic as per the above and
named like that, or commonly called / abbreviated that. In case of name
clashes, e.g. other on-topic projects already present using the same name or
there being obvious trademark issues, our team will try to find a good
solution. The same applies if your name contains characters that can't be used
on our services for technical reasons.

The registration should be either done by or have received the official
blessing of someone who is able to speak for the project. This could be:

- The project founder
- A lead developer
- Someone in a management position
- A board member
- ...

### How to register as a project

We recommend you contact us as per the
[Projects & Community team](/chanreg#the-projects--community-team) section
before registering, so we can already check whether your project is likely to
be considered eligible to a registration. Once done, we will need the
following information from you:

```markdown
# About your project
Your project name(s):
Your project description:
Can we list your project publicly, such as on the libera.chat website:
Libera Chat staff member you have discussed this registration with:
Links to places we can find out more about your project:
(e.g. website, source code repositories or similar)

# About you and your staff
Your NickServ account:
Your relationship to / position in the project:
NickServ of group contacts and if their status is hidden/public:

# Channels and cloaks (see below)
Channels you'd like to claim:
(typically #projectname and #projectname-*)
Would you like ONLY group contacts to be able to register these channels with
ChanServ?:
Cloak namespaces you'd like to claim:
(typically projectname/*)
```

Group contacts are the members in your project that will be the
official interface between Libera.Chat and your organization.
They are the ones who can claim channels in your namespace(s) and
request cloaks for your members/users.
You can tell us whether these should be visible to the public or not.
If you need specific rules or abilities for your group contacts,
check with our team to get the option that fits your structure best.

Please send this information as an e-mail to <projects@libera.chat>.

Our team will then get in touch with you and do a claim verification. These
are done per case and usually contain some sort of check of domain / code
repository ownership or the likes.

### Benefits of registered projects

Registered projects can profit from the following benefits:

- Channels in their namespace can be claimed
- Optional cloaks are available for members.
  These replace the hostname part with a custom string, e.g.
  `@yourproject/developer/alex` or `@yourproject/taylor`
- We offer to send messages about important releases or events of your project
  as a "wallop" message to all our users who opted in to receiving these
