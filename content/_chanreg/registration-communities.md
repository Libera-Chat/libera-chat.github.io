Community channels on Libera.Chat are for topics that would otherwise be
eligible for a project registration but do not have an official representation
(e.g. `#linux`), or are significantly relevant to our intended userbase (e.g.
`#windows`).

### How to register as a community

We recommend you contact us as per the
[Projects & Community team](/chanreg#the-projects--community-team) section
before registering, so we can already check whether your community is likely
to be considered eligible to a registration. Once done, we will need the
following information from you:

```markdown
# About your community
Your community name(s):
Your community description:
Can we list your community publicly, such as on the libera.chat website:
Libera Chat staff member you have discussed this registration with:

# About you and your staff
Your NickServ account:
Your relationship / affiliation with the community:
NickServ of group contacts and if their status is hidden/public:

# Channels and cloaks (see below)
Channels you'd like to claim:
(typically #communityname and #communityname-*)
Would you like ONLY group contacts to be able to register these channels with
ChanServ?:
(The cloaks will be formatted like this:
about/YourCommunityNameHere/name or about/YourCommunityNameHere/role/name)
```

group contacts are the members in your community that will be the official
interface between you and Libera.Chat.
They are the ones who can claim channels in your namespace(s) and request
cloaks for your members/users.
You can tell us whether these should be visible to the public or not.
If you need specific rules or abilities for your group contacts,
check with our team to get the option that fits your structure best.

Please send this information as an e-mail to <projects@libera.chat>, our team
will then get in touch with you.

### Benefits of a community

Registered communities can profit from the following benefits:

- Channels in their namespace can be claimed (with `/msg ChanServ CLAIM`)
- Optional cloaks are available for members.
  These replace the hostname part with `@about/yourcommunity/custompart`,
  and can be requested on `#libera-communities`.
