## Other Questions

### Should we add a weekly goal to our Liberapay?

Our treasurer determined that 250 SEK per week of reliable Liberapay income
covers our operational expenses with a reasonable margin for emergencies.
Our income has dipped below that. Therefore, it was decided to use
Liberapay's "weekly goal" feature to publish this figure as a goal to be met
in hopes of encouraging contribution. Other forms of fundraising were briefly
discussed, but it was decided the topic would be revisited should our
finances become unsustainable.
