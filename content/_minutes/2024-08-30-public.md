## Other questions

### Should we shut down `#libera-matrix`?

Libera.Chat runs the `#libera-matrix` channel,
which was formerly used for public discussion and announcements regarding the
[now-disabled Matrix bridge](/news/official-matrix-bridge-farewell).
Keeping the channel open requires staff to remain present and available
to handle moderation when necessary. However, the channel is now
almost always silent, and any activity is typically discussion about
the state of Matrix-to-IRC bridging in general.
Therefore, it was suggested that the channel should be closed.
It was also suggested that a private coordination channel with
Element Matrix Services' personnel should be closed as it is also disused.

The meeting decided against closing `#libera-matrix` at this time,
as it remains a moderated channel suitable for discussion of Matrix-to-IRC
bridging. It was also agreed that it would be acceptable for certain trusted
non-staff members of `#libera-matrix` to be given operator privileges
should staff decide the channel needs increased supervision.
