excerpt: Discussion about staff burnout, contributor cloaks

## Propositions and Motions

### None

## Other Questions

### How can we help staff with burnout?

It was noted that staff activity during May was lower than normal, resulting
in the network's birthday channel not being opened up.

There was not much discussion on this topic, except to point out that lack
of activity is not entirely indicative of burnout, and a suggestion to look
for more staff members.

### Should we have contributor cloaks?

The meeting discussed whether we should start handing out cloaks of the form
`libera/contributor/foo` to people who are not staff members, but actively
contribute toward the development and/or maintenance of the software we use.
No-one was opposed to the idea and a couple of candidates were suggested.

It was decided to wait a while for more suggestions to be made, so that
people who think they are deserving but did not immediately receive one
don't feel left out or overlooked.

It was also decided that it would be something that staff collectively
choose to hand out; people will not receive them by asking for them.

Finally, they will confer no other status or privilege for the moment.
