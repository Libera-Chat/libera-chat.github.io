## Propositions and Motions

### Privacy Policy Update

A suggestion for a change to our privacy policy around usage of user-data to
contact users regarding their network usage (think `your channel may expire
soon`) was discussed. A rewrite has been considered and will be discussed
further on its completion.

### Complaints process

We discussed our complaints process and decided it would be a good idea to
review it.

## Other Questions

### Maximum grouped nicknames

Currently our has a maximum of 20 nicknames per user. An idea to reduce this
(along with an increase in account lifetime) raised. We decided that as we
had not accepted the account lifetime change, this change would not have any
good impact on the network as a whole.
