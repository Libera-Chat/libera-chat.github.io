## Proposition and motions

In this relatively short meeting, we first discussed potential new
staff candidates and decided to invite two candidates to join us.

## Other questions

### Matrix bridge discussion

The MGM talked about a delay on disabling Matrix portaling: Since the
previous MGM, we had agreed to move the date in discussions with EMS,
the new date being August 11th. We determined that this extension of
the timeline had broad consensus in the organization.

We then went on to the topic of future options and the possibility of
further delays, resulting in agreement that any future delays need to be
avoided.
