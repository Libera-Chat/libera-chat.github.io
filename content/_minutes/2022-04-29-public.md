## Propositions and motions

### Confirmation of new members

The staff body voted to confirm two new members.

### Bylaw changes

The staff body approved two changesets to the bylaws. Firstly, to change some
optional language (should) to mandatory language (shall). The intent of these
passages remained unchanged. Secondly, to change the structure and timeline of
some elements of the process of structuring the org, allowing for more
flexibility in changing the board outside of the end-of-year period.
