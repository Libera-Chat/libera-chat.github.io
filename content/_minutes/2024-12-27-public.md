    users, bylaws change for general secretary position
---

## Proposition and motions

### LLM blog post

Staff discussed whether we were comfortable with the recent LLM blog post
remaining just as a suggested etiquette or whether its principles should be
enshrined in the network's official policies.

It was decided to leave it as-is for the moment, subject to review if
something should arise that would make us reconsider.

### Clarifying policy on use of the network by minors and explicit content

Staff discussed whether we should amend our network policy to exclude adult
content communities and discourage the sharing of all content of an explicit
nature, simultaneously with explicitly stating that the network is not
intended for use by minors.

This vote passed unanimously.

### Bylaws change for general secretary position

Staff discussed whether we should amend our bylaws to officially codify the
recently-elected position of general secretary, outlining their duties for
all to see.

This vote passed unanimously.
