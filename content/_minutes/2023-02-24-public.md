    Ironing out oper privsets, Matrix bridge problems, and clarifying
    the license for our logo.

## Proposition and motions

None.

## Other questions

### `oper:receive_immunity`

A staff member had noticed that not all staff privsets contain
`oper:receive_immunity` which marks a client as being unkickable in
channels that we enable `chm_operpeace` (+M) for.

We decided to fix that and apply `oper:receive_immunity` to all staff
privsets.

### Matrix bridge problems

We discussed problems that the Matrix bridge creates for IRC-side users,
channel operators and for network operations.

After discussing a few possible actions we could take, we decided to get
to ask the communities that use Libera for feedback, to interface with
the bridge operators and request information that helps us understand
the problems better and to assess the impact of abuse mitigation that
affects Matrix homeservers with open registration enabled.

### How is our logo licensed?

We decided to clarify the license of the logo in the website repo. We
are going to explore what assigning the logo copyright to the org would
entail.
