excerpt: Hiring new staff and a proposal regarding additional funding

## Propositions and Motions

### Hiring

The meeting discussed potential members to invite to the staff team. It
decided to extend invitations out to two potential members, pending interest
by those people in becoming staff.

### Do we want proactive outreach to orgs for funding?

The discussion centered around whether the organisation should officially
contact other organisations who make use of Libera services to see if they
would be interested in providing any form of monetary sponsorship. The
proposal was deemed to be premature with respect to details, and the meeting
decided it warranted further discussion in asynchronous communication venues
before bringing it back to the meeting at a future date.
