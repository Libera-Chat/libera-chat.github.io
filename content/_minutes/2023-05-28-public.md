## Other Questions

### Enabling teeth in Murdochite

Last year, we wrote an abuse management tool called Murdochite, which scans
incoming connections from Matrix to determine if the homeserver responsible
for initiating those connections allows registration without verification.

At the time, we did not enable its enforcement action, so a connection would
only be flagged to staff, rather than be automatically disconnected from the
network.

Staff discussed the impact this could have upon our user experience,
including sharing some statistics of how many homeservers would have been
banned during some recent bridge upsets that resulted in mass reconnections.

Ultimately it was decided that we should leave it as it is.

### An organisation mascot

Further discussion was held about having an official mascot, what it would
be (species, name, ...), and who we could approach to design it for us.
