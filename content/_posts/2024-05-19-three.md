Hello everyone!

When we opened Libera Chat three whole years ago, we were not sure how things
would play out. There were definitely doubts that we would still be here
today, working hard to provide you all with a stable collaboration platform.
But here we are!

Besides standing up a whole darn network in the blink of an eye, we are also
very proud of the various other things we have accomplished in the past 36
months. We have:

- Made it [easier to manage your channels][channelmgmt] including
[improvements to ban masks][extban].

- Added several privacy improvements [such as hiding idle time][idletime] and
[autocloaking *new* accounts][autocloaking].

- Added [features that expanded autonomy for Group Contacts][groupmgmt],
allowing them to self-manage their namespaces without waiting for staff.

- Worked out [a solution to login failure spam][loginspam], which was a
common complaint.

We are also still actively working on our next generation IRCd, called Sable.
You can [check out the repository][sable] or pop in to `#libera-dev` for more
information about that.

Finally, starting some time *next month*, our [freewear shop][freewear] will
start carrying a new design; the libera.cat logo from this year's April Fools
prank! Keep an eye on our [bluesky][bluesky] or [fosstodon][fosstodon] social
accounts for an announcement about that.

In the mean time, please join us in `#libera-birthday` to celebrate!
