Good afternoon, all

[At the start of this month][prev] my colleague Allie wrote a blog post
detailing the reasons and process leading up to the Matrix bridge having one
mode of operation, portalling, disabled. In this post we set out a timeline,
agreed with our colleagues at Matrix, stating that this would happen by the 31st
of July.

Yesterday evening our partners at Matrix contacted us stating that a number of
security vulnerabilities had been identified in the bridge that have pre-empted
work on the deportalling process. Combined with lingering issues with Plumbing
(the alternate bridge mode that will be maintained going forward), and an
under-resourced team working on the bridge, they have requested an extension to
the deadline we have previously agreed.

**Given the nature of the issues, we have agreed to extend the deadline to the
11th of August, 2023, providing an additional 2 weeks to address these high
priority issues and improve the plumbing situation. New portal creation will be
disabled on the 31st, with all portals being turned off on the 11th.**

We understand that this means breaking the promise we have made to our users,
and we're sorry for any users who have rushed ahead of their preferred schedule
to move to plumbed rooms, but on balance we decided it was better to provide an
extension than it would be to demand Matrix decide between running an insecure
bridge or face being shut off entirely.

## Moving forward

While delays and surprises have been a common theme of our working relationship
with Matrix, our colleagues have been honest and upfront with this issue, and
have posted a blog you can read [here][matrixblog]. This post acknowledges the
issues that have lead to missing the deadline we agreed, and confirms their
desire to do the right thing for users and communities on Libera and Matrix.

With that in mind, and with Matrix having identified their limiting factors, we
do not see any reason to delay beyond the 11th. If resourcing is an issue, it is
Matrix's responsibility to provide adequate attention to the task or else risk
major disruption to our mutual communities.

## Questions? Comments?

As always, Libera.Chat staff will be available in `#libera` and `#libera-matrix`
to offer assistance and discussion.

Yours aye,
