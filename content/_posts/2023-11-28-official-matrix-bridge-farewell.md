title: Official Matrix bridge farewell

Hello, I am the bearer of unfortunate news.

Following the
[disabling of the official Element Matrix Services (EMS) operated bridge][bridgedown]
between the Matrix network and Libera.Chat IRC network, staff of Libera Chat
met with staff from The Matrix.org Foundation in mid October to discuss the
future of the bridge.

Due to various constraints, The Foundation informed us that it cannot take on
the obligation of the needed modifications in a timely manner, nor can it
commit to operating the official bridge going forward.

Upon receiving this information we requested that The Foundation and EMS
arrange a graceful sunset of the bridge, a clean-up of bridged rooms so that
users are no longer misled or confused due to the presence of non-functional
ghosts, and to take accountability for the delay in wrapping things up. You
can [read about their plan on their blog][matrixblog].

We have written a [new FAQ about Matrix][matrixfaq] to address this sunset
and give more information about the future of Matrix use on Libera.Chat. We
would also like to extend to our communities a sincere apology; it has taken
far too long to coordinate communications with EMS and The Foundation to
clarify the fate of the bridge, and we regret any inconvenience the delay of
this information has caused.
