excerpt: The Oregon State University Open Source Lab needs help!
---

Hey everyone,

It's been a bit of a bloggy month here, but this one is critically important.

The [Oregon State University Open Source Lab][osuosl] (OSUOSL, or OSL) has
reached out to inform the open source world that that
[the lab is in dire jeopardy][blog].

This is bad.

It is a matter of fact that Libera.Chat simply would not be what we are, were
it not for OSUOSL. While they are not currently a sponsor, they were a sponsor
on the network we descend from. As you can see
[in slide 16 of this slideshow][slideshow], they were a very generous sponsor.
We thank them for that, and stand with them now in their moment of need.

To this day, they continue to sponsor projects we depend on. They sponsor the
Debian project, which our infrastructure runs on. They sponsor OFTC, which
Debian uses for support and collaboraton. They host a huge number of other
projects which we either rely on, or ourselves support with infrastructure.

The amount of support that OSUOSL has provided to open source communities over
the years is so unbelieveably vast. It is almost certain that something which
you personally rely on either relies, or formerly relied, on OSUOSL. This may
be direct support, or via support of something upstream. You may think this is
hyperbole, but it is not.

If you love open source software and free culture projects as much as we do,
and wish to ensure that OSUOSL can continue to nurture the ecosystem in the
future, please consider using your preferred social media platform to
either signal boost [their call for help][fedi] or post with the
[#osuosl][tag] tag to offer your heartfelt support.
