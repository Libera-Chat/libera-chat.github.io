## Organisation and purpose

1. The legal name of the organisation is Libera Chat.

2. The purpose of the organisation is to encourage and facilitate community
   space, tools, and facilities intended to further the development and
   adoption of free & open source (FOSS) software and peer directed
   projects (PDP).

   The organisation will primarily do this by maintaining for general use
   an IRC network, operated and supported by volunteers.

   It may also engage in other activities which complement this purpose, such
   as community events, or provision of other services and tools or the
   undertaking of other activities which benefit FOSS or PDP.

   It may also engage in activity which supports this purpose, such as the
   development and maintenance of software, training, or other activities
   which benefit FOSS or PDP, fundraising, or sale of goods and merchandise.

3. The organisation is an ideologically and religiously unaffiliated Swedish
   "ideell förening".

4. The seat of the organisation is in Höganäs, Höganäs Kommun.

5. The fiscal year of the organisation is from the 1st January to the 31st
   December.

## Membership

1. Membership is open to and required for staff of the Libera Chat IRC network
   and granted by approval of a monthly general meeting. Staff status on the
   Libera Chat IRC network is limited to members.

2. The monthly general meeting may extend an invitation to a person to become
   staff of the Libera Chat IRC network. The monthly general meeting may not
   invite a person who have failed a vote for membership in the last two (2)
   years without simultaneously approving them for membership.

3. All staff of the Libera Chat IRC network must be approved for membership no
   later than two (2) regularly scheduled monthly general meetings after
   becoming staff, or have their staff status revoked.

4. There are two levels of membership: ordinary member, and quorum member.
   Members of either type may at any time switch between the two types of
   member status by notifying the board. The board are always quorum members.

5. Any quorum member who, in any two full, consecutive calendar months, does
   not attend any Monthly General Meetings, becomes an ordinary member
   immediately after the end of the second such month.

6. Membership is terminated if:

   - The member withdraws their membership, or

   - The member is suspended.

## Decisions

1. The decision-making organs of the organisation ranked from highest to
   lowest authority are:

   - Monthly General Meeting,

   - Board,

   - Specialised Committees.

2. All meetings may be held through digital channels such as video, voice, or
   text.

3. All meeting minutes should be signed digitally with PGP or physically
   signed.

4. Decisions are generally taken by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached
   a vote should be held.

5. If a vote is held, a simple majority is enforced. In other words, more than
   50% of the votes are needed for a proposal to win. Abstentions are not
   counted when determining the majority.

6. For each meeting each member of the given organ has one vote.

7. When electing persons, the following additional points apply:

   - To be elected, each candidate must have over 50% of the votes cast

   - If no candidate has more than 50% of the votes cast then the person with
     the least votes is eliminated and a new round is held, this is repeated
     until a person fulfils this condition.

   - If only two persons remain and the round ends in a tie the winner out of
     the two should be determined randomly.

8. Voting by proxy is not allowed.

## Monthly General Meeting

1. The Monthly General Meeting should be held once per month.

2. The board should invite the membership to the monthly general meeting at
   least one (1) week before it commences. The invitation should include
   the date, time, and location for the meeting.

3. All meeting documents should be available to the membership at least
   one (1) week before the start of the meeting.

4. All members of the organisation have the right to participate, speak, make
   proposals, and vote on the meeting.

5. The monthly general meeting needs a quorum of at least 50% of the
   organisation's quorum members.

6. Auditors have the right to participate and speak during the meeting, and
   the right to make proposals in questions pertaining to their duties.

7. The monthly general meeting should deal with at least the following:

   - The opening of the meeting.

   - Election of:

     - The chair for the monthly general meeting,

     - The secretary for the monthly general meeting,

     - Two members to approve the minutes and count votes.

   - Determination of eligible voters.

   - Approval of the agenda.

   - Propositions and motions.

   - Other questions.

   - The closing of the meeting.

8. During either the January, February, or March monthly general meeting the
   following additional items should be dealt with:

   - Presentation and approval of:

     - Annual report,

     - Financial statements,

     - Audit report.

   - Discharge of last year's board.

   - Membership fee.

   - Election of:

     - Chair of the board,

     - Treasurer,

     - Auditors,

     - Vice chair of the board.

9. All documents, including the minutes, from a monthly general meeting
   should be adjusted and published to the membership no more than four (4)
   weeks after the end of the meeting.

10. All documents, including the adjusted minutes from a monthly general
    meeting should be released publicly no more than six (6) weeks after the
    end of the meeting.

    Minutes should normally include the essence of discussion and substantive
    decision-making, but not specific comments or identifiable details of
    members.

    Publicly-released documents may redact 'confidential' items, which if
    disclosed may be harmful to individuals or infrastructure, could breach
    legal privilege, or are otherwise sensitive.

    The reason for treating an item as 'confidential' must be noted in the
    released minutes, and items to be redacted should normally be discussed
    during the meeting, but may also be introduced by the secretary
    following the meeting.

    In either case, redactions must be included by the secretary in the
    minutes published to the membership to allow for concerns or
    objections to be raised and ideally resolved prior to public release.

    In the event of irresolvable objections being raised, items will be
    presumed to be 'redacted' but must be brought by the secretary to the
    next meeting for resolution.

11. An extraordinary general meeting can be called if the board, the
    auditors, or a majority of the membership requests so.

12. Extraordinary general meetings are governed by the same bylaws as an
    ordinary monthly general meeting.

## Board

1. The board is responsible for managing the organisation's member list,
   finances, and other assets in accordance with the will of the monthly
   general meetings. The board should also ensure that the bylaws are
   followed.

2. The board must ensure that meeting minutes and financial records are
   archived for the lifetime of the organisation and at least seven (7) years
   thereafter.

3. The board consists of the chair and treasurer elected by a general meeting
   and one representative of each specialised committee.

4. The board meets if the chair of the board, the auditors, or a majority of
   the board members call for it. The board needs a quorum of at least half
   of the board members.

5. In addition to the board members, the auditors have the right to
   participate and speak at board meetings.

6. The monthly general meeting electing the chair of the board should also
   elect a vice chair to act as chair in the chair's absence.

## Auditors

1. Once per year the general meeting elects up to two auditors.

2. The duties of the auditors are:

   - Examine if the board follows the bylaws, and audit the actions of the
     board, the financial and annual report, and the board's management of the
     organisation's bookkeeping.

   - Make an audit report at least one (1) week before the general meeting it
     will be covered during.

   - To include their opinion of how the board has carried out their duties
     and a proposal for if the board should be granted discharge in the audit
     report.

3. The auditors have the right to inspect any activities carried out by
   the organisation as well as meetings of the board and specialised
   committees.

4. The auditors cannot be members of the board.

## Complaints

1. The membership shall appoint a Complaints Rota to handle complaints about the
   organisation's staff. Members on the Complaints Rota must be members of the
   organisation.

2. If, at the time of a Monthly General Meeting, there are fewer than four
   members on the Complaints Rota, the meeting should attempt to appoint more
   members until there are at least four such members.

3. On receiving a complaint, the Complaints Rota shall select two of its
   members, at random, to hear the complaint. Members with known conflicts of
   interest shall be excluded from selection. These members shall be known, in
   the context of the particular complaint, as the "Complaint Processors"

4. The Complaint Processors must agree on the action to be taken, if any.

5. The Complaint Processors must respect the privacy of complainants and all
   other parties. The Complaint Processors may recruit other members of the
   organisation to assist with their invstigation. Other members, including the
   Board and Complaints Rota members who are not actively working on the
   complaint, should not have automatic access to it.

6. If any party to a complaint disagrees with the result, they can appeal it.
   Libera Chat members require no permission to appeal, while non-members must
   seek the permission of the Board. If the Board denies such permission, it
   must give a reason.

   There are two appeals to be used in order:

   - Appeal to another two random Complaints Rota members, and

   - Appeal to the entire membership.

   Any party wishing to appeal must immediately inform the Board. If a party has
   not informed the Board of their intention to appeal after 30 calendar days
   from the date of the result, their right to appeal lapses.

7. In the event that a complaint is appealed to the entire membership of the
   organisation, the Board is responsible for scheduling a meeting of the
   membership to hear the appeal.

8. A complaint that is appealed to the entire membership of the organisation may
   contain sensitive information that should not be shared widely. The Complaint
   Processors should prepare a case for the membership, excluding such details.
   The Auditors of the organisation may be called upon to attest that the
   Complaint Processors' case is a faithful account of the complaint.

9. Parties to complaints who are Libera Chat members have the right to speak at
   their own final appeal, and to hear all sides' arguments. They should not be
   present when the resulting actions are discussed. The Board should dismiss
   any such party if they reveal, or threaten to reveal, private information
   about the complaint, or the other parties to it.

10. An appeal to the entire membership is decided by a vote between two options:
    to carry or vacate the outcome of the complaint. This may optionally be
    preceded by any number of votes to amend or not amend the decision. Each
    vote is a simple majority vote between exactly two choices. If a vote to
    amend has no majority, the decision is not amended. If a vote on the outcome
    has no majority, the complaint is carried.

11. If the outcome of any stage of a complaint is to relieve a Libera Chat staff
    member of some or all of their duties, those duties can be temporarily
    suspended pending the conclusion of the appeal process. If a staff member
    whose duties are temporarily suspended is a member of Libera Chat, their
    membership is unaffected by this status.

12. At most two members can be temporarily suspended at any time.

13. Time constraints are imposed on the complaints process as follows:

    - Complaints must be acknowledged within 7 calendar days of receipt by the
      Complaints Rota.

    - An initial result must be returned by the Complaint Processors within 30
      calendar days of receipt of the complaint by the Complaints Rota.

    - A party wishing to appeal has 7 calendar days to prepare their appeal,
      starting from the date they notified the Board of their intention to
      appeal.

    - The result of the first appeal must be returned by the Complaint
      Processors not before all parties have exercised or waived their right to
      appeal, and within 14 days of the end of the first 30-day appeal period.

    - The Board must schedule the hearing for the second appeal not before all
      parties have exercised or waived their right to appeal, and within 21 days
      of the end of the second 30-day appeal period.

14. If, at the time of any Monthly General Meeting, a member is temporarily
    suspended, and will have been temporarily suspended for more than 59
    calendar days by the end of the current calendar month, the Monthly General
    Meeting must decide whether or not to continue their temporary suspension.

## Specialised Committees

1. There are three specialised committees: Operations, Engineering, and
   Projects & Community.

2. Membership in one of the specialised committees is granted either by a
   monthly general meeting, or by the members of the specialised committee.

3. The specialised committees each elect a representative to the board,
   subject to approval by the Monthly General Meeting.

4. The specialised committees are responsible for defining their mission
   statement and rules of operation, providing these do not conflict with
   these bylaws, and subject to approval by the Monthly General Meeting.

## Eligibility

1. All members of the organisation are eligible for all positions in the
   organisation.

2. In addition to the members of the organisation, non-members are eligible
   for the position of auditor.

## Signing authority

1. The board should appoint one or more board members to sign on behalf of
   the organisation, either jointly or individually.

## Suspension

1. The monthly general meeting may suspend a member from the organisation for
   any reason. The person in question to be suspended may not vote or
   participate during the discussion of their suspension.

2. If a member's staff status on the Libera Chat IRC network is suspended, a
   discussion and vote on suspending their membership should be held on the
   next monthly general meeting. If the member is not suspended, their staff
   status should be reinstated.

## Interpretation of the bylaws

1. If there are conflicts around interpreting the bylaws, the board's
   interpretation takes precedent. The board must however account for the
   opinion of the auditors before making their decision.

2. Decisions about interpretations of the bylaws must be raised at the next
   general meeting where they should be ratified.

## Changes to the bylaws

1. Changes to the bylaws require a vote and at least a two-thirds majority on
   a monthly general meeting.

## Dissolution

1. Proposals to dissolve the organisation must be signed and can only be
   decided by a monthly general meeting.

2. Dissolution requires a vote with at least a two-thirds majority on two
   consecutive monthly general meetings.

3. The first monthly general meeting that votes for dissolution should also
   determine what should happen with the assets of the organisation.
