- type: $a
  name: account name
  description: |
    Match users identified to the account specified in the parameter.
    Accepts wildcards; an empty `$a` matches any logged-in user.
    For example: `/mode #channel +q $a:example` would quiet a user identified
    to services as example.
- type: $j
  name: cannot join other channel
  description: |
    Takes an exact channel name (no wildcards or globbing) as its parameter
    and matches any user who is banned from that channel. Due to caching by
    the server, a change to the target channel's ban list may not immediately
    affect a user's ability to send to the channel using `$j`.
- type: $r
  name: ircname
  description: |
    Matches on a client's ircname, or gecos. The parameter accepts wildcards.
    For example: `/mode #channel +b $r:Foo*` will ban any user whose gecos
    begins with "Foo".
- type: $x
  name: full match
  description: |
    Takes a parameter that is matched against a client's full
    `nick!username@host#gecos`. The parameter accepts wildcards.
    For example, `/mode #channel +b $x:*#Foo*` will ban any user whose gecos
    begins with Foo, or whose gecos contains "#Foo".
- type: $z
  name: connected securely
  description: |
    Accepts no parameters. Matches users who are connected via SSL/TLS.
