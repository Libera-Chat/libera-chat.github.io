## Contacting Staff

### On IRC

Assuming you can connect to IRC (`ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697`), that should be
your first point of contact with staff.

Use the IRC command `/stats p` to get a list of on-duty staff, and use
`/msg`_`nick`_ to chat with one of them.

If `/stats p` does not report anyone, or if you can't get a response, try
asking in the `#libera` channel. If your question is sensitive or private, feel
free to `/msg` any of the ops in that channel.

### By Email

Generally don't send email until directed to do so by staff, and then they will
tell you which email address to use.

But if you cannot get on-line with IRC, please use the email address that
matches your enquiry:

* policy@libera.chat for anything related to the privacy policy
* projects@libera.chat to register a project channel and/or project group
* bans@libera.chat to request a review of a network-level ban (such as a k-line)

NOTES:

1. If you're banned, don't create a new nick to bypass the ban; email directly
   instead.
1. Staff do not intervene in channel bans; talk nicely to the chan-op instead.
