Libera Chat also accepts donations via
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/liberachat/donate).

For larger payments, or other donations requiring special arrangements, please
reach out to <donations@libera.chat>.

We currently use these donations to cover the operational costs of the network
as well as the administrative upkeep of the legal entity.

If our funding situation permits it, we may also invest in improving our
services, for example by purchasing hardware or paying for software
development.

Libera Chat is committed to being a volunteer-run organisation, and will never
pay network staff for their work or engage them for any other paid work during
their service as staff.

Per [our bylaws](/bylaws) we publish an
[annual financial statement](/annual-reports/) that is reviewed by our
appointed layperson [auditors](/about).
