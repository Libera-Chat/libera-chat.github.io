title: Buy merch to support Libera Chat
---

We have a partnership with [FreeWear.org](https://www.freewear.org)
where you can buy Libera Chat branded clothes, coffee mugs, stickers and more.
In addition to you showing your support and spreading the word about us,
we receive a donation (currently up to around 2.5 Euro) per piece sold.

Have a look at
[the FreeWear.org online store](https://www.freewear.org/Libera.Chat)
to check out what Libera Chat branded merch is currently available!

Money received through this channel is handled the same as donations,
meaning it is used to cover the operational costs of the network as well as
the administrative upkeep of the legal entity. For additional details
please check out this [donations](/contributing/donate/) link.
