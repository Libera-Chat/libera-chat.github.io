There are a few ways to help us out.

## Contributing servers

- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4 GByte
- Network: **DDoS protected boxes are appreciated**, IRC does not take much bandwidth and the standard 1 GBit/s will suffice
- Staff will be managing the server remotely, so provide root access.
- The servers will run Debian 10
- The servers are named after [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element), you are free to suggest a name for your contributed server though
