title: Sponsoring Libera Chat
---

There are a few ways to help us out.

## Contributing servers

Libera Chat runs on servers provided by our generous sponsors. If you run a large, well-connected network in one of our service regions (North America, Europe, East Asia, Australia), please get in touch!

Our requirements for public-facing IRCd servers are as follows:

- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4 GB
- Disk: 20 GB
- Network: Normal usage is in the single-digit megabits per second, but peak requirements are much higher, thanks to attacks. You will need to be able to handle 100G-plus floods, and the facilities to drop them at your border.
- The servers will run Debian stable.
- The servers are named after [metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal), you are free to suggest a name for your contributed server but there is no guarantee that it will be accepted.

If you can provide networking and rack space, but not hardware, we may be able to work something out.

While we appreciate the intentions behind all such offers, please note that we do not usually accept rented consumer servers. List-price VPSs are great value, but experience has shown that they are not sufficiently resilient.

We manage servers centrally, for which we will need full, and *exclusive*, root privileges. Please note that sponsoring a server does not confer staff access, and we ask that you do not attempt to use technical means to gain such access.

If you are interested and meet the requirements, please email the operations team at hosting@libera.chat.
