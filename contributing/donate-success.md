Thank you for your donation to Libera Chat! Your donation helps us cover the
operational costs of the network as well as the administrative upkeep of the
legal entity.

If our funding situation permits it, we may also invest in improving our
services, for example by purchasing hardware or paying for software
development.

Libera Chat is committed to being a volunteer-run organisation, and will never
pay network staff for their work or engage them for any other paid work during
their service as staff.
