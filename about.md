title: About Libera Chat
---

Libera Chat is a Swedish nonprofit organisation with organisation number
802535-6448, feel free to [read our bylaws](/bylaws). The organisation is run
entirely by volunteer staff who are the members of, and have equal voting power
in, the organisation. Libera Chat's purpose is to provide services such as a
community platform for free open-source software and peer directed projects on
a volunteer basis.

Most decisions are taken by the membership as a whole. The board
primarily deals with organisational tasks like managing our bookkeeping
and keeping the member list in sync. There are also three teams within
the organisation specialising on certain areas: Projects and Community,
Engineering, and Operations. Members can choose to be part of these teams.

The board of the organisation comprises a chair, a treasurer and a
representative from each of our specialised teams. Board seats are elected
by the membership. The current board members are:

- **Chair**: njan (James Eaton-Lee)
- **Treasurer**: Swant (Svante Bengtson)
- **Projects and Community Rep**: Fuchs (Christian Loosli)
- **Engineering Rep, Vice Chair**: edk (Ed Kellett)
- **Operations Rep**: glguy (Eric Mertens)

In addition to this the organisation has two auditors elected by the membership.
Their role is to audit the board's actions on behalf of the membership.
Their yearly audit report, along with the annual report and bookkeeping of the
organisation, will be published in a yearly transparency report.
The current auditors are:

- **Auditor**: Md (Marco d'Itri)
- **Auditor**: kline (Gareth Pulham)

## Wider staff and organisation membership

specialised teams, yet without them the efforts of the specialised teams would
be in vain and more importantly day to day operation of the network would be
impossible.
