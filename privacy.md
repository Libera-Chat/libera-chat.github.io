When using Libera Chat services, Libera Chat may work with the following personal
information about you:

- Nickname on the Libera Chat IRC network
- E-mail address
- IP address/hostname
- Name and project affiliation
- Other information about your role, including if you volunteer for us
- Data regarding our interactions with you

We may also process any data you send when you use the network - for instance
messages you send which may contain your personal data are processed by our
servers, and we log actions you carry out through our services, messages you
send to our staff or support mechanisms.

This data may be used for the following purposes:

- To improve and debug the Libera Chat services.
- To manage your relationship with Libera Chat
- Account management.
- Protection from abuse.
- To enable you to reset your password.
- To contact you in relation to project registration, sponsorship, and channel
  namespace management.
- To respond to support inquiries by email or our support system.
- Compliance with valid legal processes and legislation.

This data will generally be collected directly from you or sent to us by your 
computer(s) when you use our systems. Rarely, for instance if we receive an
abuse report connected with our system, we may receive data which is not
collected directly from you.

Where data is necessary to run our service, the Lawful Basis we use will
generally be "Legitimate Interest" - where our 'Interest' is the need of Libera 
Chat to process data on you in order to operate a service which you benefit 
from, and where you have chosen to use the service, in order to make it 
available to you and others, support you effectively and prevent misuse. In 
rare instances where required by law to hold or process data, our lawful basis 
may be "Legal Obligation" or "Public Task".

We will generally not process data on you which is "Special Category" unless
you explicitly make it public, for instance by sending it to channels. In
rare instances - for instance in the event we believe criminal activity is 
being undertaken on our systems - we may process it for reasons of
substantial public interest.

Libera Chat does not collect or log private or public IRC messages. However,
users may privately log messages they send and receive so be mindful of the
personal information you share as it may be logged by third parties, which is
beyond the control of Libera Chat.

Libera Chat will not share your data with third parties for direct marketing
purposes. Rarely, we may share information with third parties such as other 
service providers or Law Enforcement Agencies in order to prevent the abuse 
of our systems, staff, or users. We will only do this on a case-by-case basis,
and where necessary to prevent significant harm, disruption, or criminal use
of our systems or targeting of our staff.

Libera Chat normally stores your data collected on the IRC network for the
purpose of debugging and restoration for no more than 60 days after you last
connect to the network, or delete your account. Whichever comes last.

Data collected for the purposes of recording and mitigating abuse may be kept
for up to 365 days after the abuse occured, or the mitigation ended, whichever
comes last. The following information is covered by this policy:

- network bans (target, setter, reason, duration, timestamp, known aliases)
- connections affected by network bans (nickname, username, hostname,
  IP address, timestamp of effect)
- account registrations for the purposes of network policy violation (email
  address, nickname, username, hostname, IP address, timestamp, known aliases)
- other narrative or case-handling data - for instance details of your
  misuse of our systems or interactions with our staff or others - where 
  needed for handling a specific case

Data collected by email or our support system in relation to project
registration, sponsorship and channel namespace management will be stored at
least until the project is deregistered or the sponsorship is terminated, this
information may be stored for longer for purposes of restoration.

Any financial transactions with Libera Chat such as when sponsoring the
organisation will be stored for 7 years to comply with Swedish law.

Data collected by other means will be reviewed yearly and any data no longer
needed for the purposes it was originally collected for will be deleted.
